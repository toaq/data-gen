# `data-gen`

This repository contains a number of scripts for generating processed
data for use in downstream Toaq applications. This data is then
published to the [`data` repository](https://github.com/toaq/data) for
use with git submodules.

* `scripts/` houses support scripts for the `Makefile` logic.
* `static/` contains files that are transplanted to the repo 1:1.
